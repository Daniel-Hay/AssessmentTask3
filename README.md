# AssessmentTask3 - Shout 

---

## Project Overview
Transcription and Summarisation Tool

## How to run the program
### Option 1: 
As I have deployed the app using streamlit, no other external dependecies are required, all you need is the linK:
https://assessment-task3-shout-audio.streamlit.app/
However, as I am using the Streamlit Community Cloud, the filesystem is temporary, therefore changes aren't seen within the data.db file.
Additionally, the app can't be ran on the school internet

### Option 2:
To run the application on your computer:
1. Open the project folder in your code editor
2. Install the packages using the requirements.txt file
3. Run the main python file, main.py
4. Ignore errors that come in the terminal
5. Use the command: streamlit run (file location)
6. Follow the onscreen instructions

## Notes:
Project uses Python 3.9.1
